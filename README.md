# dmPing
A java port of root's dmPing


# Disclaimers
I didn't originally create dmPing. This is a Java port/improvement.
[@Tess-y](https://www.github.com/Tess-y/) is the original creator; I have recieved permission from them to open source the 
/original-js command, and other things in the bot of the sort.

However, if they leave an issue on this page, asking me to remove it, it and all related things will be removed from the open source.
