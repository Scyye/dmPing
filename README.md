# dmPing
A java port of root's dmPing


# Disclaimers
I didn't originally create dmPing. This is a Java port/improvement.
[@Tess-y](https://www.github.com/Tess-y/) is the original creator; I do not have direct permission from them to include the /original-js command,
however I have 0 way of contacting them to ask for permission. So if they leave an issue on this page, asking me to remove it, it will be removed from the open source.

# Proof of my trying to contact them:

The message contents as they may be hard to read:
```
So i was thinking of open-sourcing my java port/expansion of dmPing.

There is a command where you can view the js version you made; I was wondering if when I open source, I should exclude that, or if you dont mind
```
